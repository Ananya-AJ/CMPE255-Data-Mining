Complete EDA performed on an airbnb dataset.
Used seaborn, bokeh and matplotlib for visualizations
Made one d3 visualization on visual code as the javascript was not able to read a file from colab(naturally). It didnt work even after publishing the csv file to web.
Made one d3 visualization on vscode pulling file from local and it worked there.
The colab notebook has table of contents linking each EDA and visualization part with what each cell code is doing.
Please use the kaggle.json file uplocaded to download the kaggle dataset into colab's runtime.
